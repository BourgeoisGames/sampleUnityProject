before working on the project, you have a little bit of setup you'll need to do:

-- install git lfs (https://git-lfs.github.com/)

-- add the following you your git config at ".git/config" so setup unity smartMerge tool for merg conflicts:

[mergetool "unity_yaml"]
cmd = 'C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Tools\UnityYAMLMerge.exe' merge -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"
trustExitCode = false
keepTemporaries = true
keepBackup = false
 
[merge]
tool = unity_yaml

    - you can run this tool with the command "git mergetool", it will hopefully resolve conflicts.
    
-- verify the following settings are correct in your unity editor after opening the project:
    - go to Edit > Project Settings > Editor
    - in the inspector:
        - set "Version Control" > "Mode" to "Visible Meta Files"
        - set "Asset Serialization" > "Mode" to "Force Text"
